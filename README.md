## 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Using Python & MLflow

This project is about predicting rainfall using machine learning in Python. The goal is to build a model that can tell whether it will rain or not based on past weather data.

### 📂 What’s inside this repo?

* **Rainfall.csv**: This is the dataset used to train the model. It contains weather data like temperature, humidity, and more.
* **app.py**: This is the main Python script that loads the data, trains the model, and runs the predictions.
* **Rainfall Prediction Using Python & MLflow\.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that walks through the step-by-step process of building the model. It's great for understanding how everything works.
* **templates/**: This folder contains HTML files for the frontend (if you're using a web app interface).
* **README.md**: This file, which you’re reading right now, gives an overview of the project.

### 🧠 What this project does

* Cleans and processes rainfall data
* Trains a machine learning model to predict rainfall
* Uses **MLflow** to track model performance and experiments
* Provides a simple interface to run the model and see predictions

### 🚀 Why MLflow?

MLflow is used here to keep track of different model versions, parameters, and accuracy. It helps in experimenting and improving the model over time.
